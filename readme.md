## Introduction
For the 8 days leading up to release this Figma file, I have been studying design tokens. As a result of my stdying, I descided to document my learning in this Figma file. However, I recognize there are a lot of things to improve. I consider this as a countinuous learning. Along the way, I will update when I learn and discover something new. For the next step, I aim for more advance topics, such as theming and components specific tokens.

## Disclaimer
As I mentioned earlier, this is a learning process for me. You may notice similarities with other popular design systems. This design token itself is heavily inspired from Atlassian Design Tokens.
